# 2022-FIFA-World-Cup-Prediction-by-Deep-Learning  
I used a simple deep-learning model to predict the results of the 2022 World Cup.  
I build 32-dimensional feature data including information of the FIFA ranking of the two teams playing, the results of the last 5 matches of the two teams, and the FIFA rankings of the opposing teams in the last 5 matches. The model was trained and validated by these feature data.  
The prediction accuracy of the model was about 54%.
